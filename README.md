# Project Overview
This project is a ping pong online game that allows players to compete against each other in real-time. The game is designed to be played in a web browser and allows players to connect with friends or random opponents. The game features a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for players of all skill levels to enjoy.

The approach is to begin with simple tasks, ensuring basic functionality is in place before progressing to more complex features. For example, we’ll start by implementing straightforward functionalities like user sign-up, login, and logout. Once these are working smoothly, we’ll move on to more advanced features such as two-factor authentication.

Since this is a group project, our goal is to maintain a steady workflow that doesn’t slow anyone down while delivering robust, reliable functionality. We’ll achieve this by adhering to the project requirements and best practices.
